# #practice on tuple operations like accessing, iterations and slicing elements
# #Slicing concept using tuple
# tup_val = (209, 309, 209, 99, 100)
# print(type(tup_val))
# print(tup_val[2]) # fetch the number 209 which is in 0th index place
# print(tup_val[3:5]) # fetch the numbers from 99 to 100 which starting from 3rd place of Index value to 5th place of an element (counting from 1st)
# print(tup_val[::-1]) # it displays reverse starting from last element as counted as -1 place.
# print(tup_val[:1:-1]) # to clarify on this
#
# # Accessing all the elements in the list
# num = [555, 'vijay', 666, 'rns', 10.4, 'abcd']
# print(type(num))
# for nums in num:
#     print(num)
# num1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# print(type(num1))
# for nums in num1:
#     print(nums)
# # Accessing all the elements in the tuple and checking if the defined element is in the tuple or not
# tup1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100)
# for i in tup1:
#     print(i)
# j = (100)
# k = (1000)
# if j in tup1:
#     print(f'{j} is in tup1')
# else:
